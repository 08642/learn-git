=========
* This project will consist of three separate mini-projects to get you comfortable with the kinds of activities you'll be using git for throughout the class. 
* The first mini-project you'll be mimicking the steps you'll take when you first start your personal project. Creating a repository, linking it to your computer, then pushing those changes up to your github.
* The second mini-project you'll be mimicking the steps you'll take with every DevMountain project you do. You'll 'fork' the DevMountain repository, link your computer with your fork, then pushing those changes up to your github.
* The last mini-project you'll be mimicking the steps you'll take when it's group project perioid. You'll fork your groups repo, link your computer with your fork, push changes to your github, then make a 'Pull Request' into your groups repo.

##Mini-Project 1: Personal Project
### Step 1: Create a Repository on Github
* Let's  jump ahead a month or two and pretend like we just got to personal project periods. Because you're not an idiot, you're going to be pushing your code up to github frequently. In order to do that, you first need to create a repository on github to push to. Head over to your github account then in the top right hand corner click the '+' button and click 'new repository'. Enter the name of your repository then click 'Create Repository'. This repository is where your code for this project will now live.
### Step 2: Set up the Upstream
* Once you create your repository, you'll need to connect that repository with your code on your computer. 
* Create a folder called 'myProject' then inside that folder create a file called 'myName.js'. Add your name to that file and then save it. 
* Now in your terminal navigate to your 'myProject' folder. Once inside that folder, type ```git init```. You've just told your computer that you want git to watch the 'myProject' folder and keep track of any changes - basically making it so you can now run git commands inside of this folder. 
* Now that you've initialzied your 'myProject' folder, we need to tell your computer where the location of your github repository is. To do this you create what is called an 'upstream'.
