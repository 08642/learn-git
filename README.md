=========
* This project will consist of three separate mini-projects to get you comfortable with the kinds of activities you'll be using git for throughout the class. 
* The first mini-project you'll be mimicking the steps you'll take when you first start your personal project. Creating a repository, linking it to your computer, then pushing those changes up to your github.
* The second mini-project you'll be mimicking the steps you'll take with every DevMountain project you do. You'll 'fork' the DevMountain repository, link your computer with your fork, then pushing those changes up to your github.
* The last mini-project you'll be mimicking the steps you'll take when it's group project perioid. You'll fork your groups repo, link your computer with your fork, push changes to your github, then make a 'Pull Request' into your groups repo.
